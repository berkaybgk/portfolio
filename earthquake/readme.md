***Earthquake Analysis***


**This is my work on earthquakes around Turkey. My initial goal was to develop a predictive model using the earthquake data starting from 1990 which everyone can reach through USGS. The data mainly consists of coordinate values, depth and other measurement related data.**

**About this project:**

You can see my attempts on the data using several different models. Under trials.py, you can find the code for the models I have tried. I have also included the data I have used in the 'resources' folder. The data is in csv format, and you can use it for your own analysis. You can check the conclusions in the model_evaluation.ipynb file.
